# D3

The purpose of this activity was to analyze given data set, create charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau, rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 
MOE stands for "margin of error."

Tasks performed:

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Use D3 techniques to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
	Code for this graphic is in the app.js file 
	Include state abbreviations in the circles.

Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

Include more demographics and more risk factors. Place additional labels in the scatter plot and give them click events so that users can decide which data 
to display. Animate the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. Do this for at least two risk factors for each axis. 

Incorporate d3-tip

Implement D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. 
Add tooltips to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
